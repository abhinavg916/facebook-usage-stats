Facebook Usage Stats
======================

### Introduction

I realize that I have been liking too many things on Facebook and likes have lost its meaning. Therefore I built this Chrome extension to limit myself to 10 Facebook posts/comments likes a day.

Also, it shows me how much time I spend on the Facebook page and I will know how much time I have wasted.

### Features
